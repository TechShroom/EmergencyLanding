One Time Things (Do these and mark them as complete):
- Implement Entity, World, Render, etc. to full classes (Currently mostly empty)
- Add GUI system

Continuing check (Keep checking these during development):
- Optimize render
- Ensure thread safety: we will be using threads for ticking at some point

Ideas? Put here:
- File system handling 
- Media API(Load, Play, Modify audio and video)
